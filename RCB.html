              Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) is a franchise cricket team in
              the Indian Premier League (IPL), representing the city of
              Bangalore, Karnataka. Established in 2008, RCB is owned by United
              Spirits (a part of Diageo).

              The team is known for its strong fan base, flamboyant brand, and
              star-studded line-ups featuring players like
              <strong>Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Chris Gayle,</strong> and
              currently <strong>Faf du Plessis</strong> as captain.

              Despite being one of the most popular teams in the league, RCB has
              never won an IPL title, though they have reached the finals three
              times (2009, 2011, and 2016). The team is often known for its
              explosive batting but has struggled with consistency, particularly
              in the bowling department.

              Their team slogan is <strong> "Play Bold,"</strong> reflecting
              their aggressive and fearless style of play.
